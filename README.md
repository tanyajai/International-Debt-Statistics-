The International Debt Statistics (IDS) database that we are using is hosted and made publicly available by The World Bank.

IDS is designed to respond to user demand for timely, comprehensive data on trends in external debt in low- and middle-income countries. These debt trends are split into various topics, which are further categorized into various indicators that contribute to debt.

While analyzing we had 4 important goals for our analysis:
1. Understanding the top factors that influence outstanding debts for the countries.
2. Summarizing the total outstanding debts for all the countries over the years.
3. Analyzing the trends of debt variation for various topics over the years for top 5 countries.
4. Analyzing the factors contributing most to debt for India.
